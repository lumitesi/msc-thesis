The work presented in this document would never see the light of day if not for the collaboration of several people to whom I wish to manifest my profound gratitude and recognition. 

First I would like to thank my advisors and members of the ICBD Project, Professors Paulo Lopes, Pedro Medeiros and Nuno Preguiça, for there advice, always supporting this work and the countless hours spent trying to find the better course of action especially when I would find myself lost and overwhelmed.

It is necessary to leave a special thanks to Engineer Miguel Martins from Reditus S.A, to whom I had the pleasure of closing work for more than a year. Who taught me a lot, not only from his vast knowledge of computer systems, backed by endless years of experience and without who this work would not be possible but also for the many conversations we held in the realms of Physics, Economics and History. I will always admire how a person can hold such a large body of knowledge.

I also like to extend my recognition to Dr Henrique Mamede and Engineer Sérgio Rita, also from Reditus S.A., for the opportunity given, constant support and the warm-hearted welcome in my year-long stay with SolidNetworks.

Finally, my very heartful gratitude to my family and friend for their unconditional support, for putting up with me when my work problems went home with me, but were always there with a kind word and some crazy plan to make me forget work for a couple of hours and enjoy their fellowship and time spent together.

I also would like to acknowledge the following institutions for their hosting and financial support: \textit{Departamento de Informática and Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia of the Universidade NOVA de Lisboa} (DI-FCT NOVA); the \textit{NOVA Laboratory of Computer Science and Informatics} (NOVA LINCS) in particular the Computer Systems group; \textit{SolidNetworks – Business Consulting, Lda} of the \textit{Reditus S.A. Group}; and the funding provided through the \textit{COMPETE2020 / PORTUGAL2020} program for the \textit{iCBD} project (POCI-01-0247-FEDER-011467).
