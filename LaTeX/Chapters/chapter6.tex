\label{sec:conclusions}

As a result of our research and experimentation, we found that:

\begin{itemize}
	\item bla..
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Replica to Replica iMI transfer
	\item Diskless Servers / selfhosting - provision iCBD Servers from iMI
	\item Micro Services, as started with this thesis (building iCBD-Replication as a standalone application) the functionalities of the iCBD Core can be segmented in multiple small services, in order to achieve a better use of resources and an easier deployment in a multi homed scenario.
	\item Infrastructure as Code, orchestrate and automate all the process described in the chapter Implementation of a Cache Server. (Cloud Native Infrastructure Pag.66)
\end{itemize}
